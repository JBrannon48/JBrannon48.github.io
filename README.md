This is the website I made for my robotics team,
[Team 4829 - Titanium Tigers](https://www.titaniumtigers4829.com/). 
This website was made from scratch without a template.
If you want to use this code for your own website/project, go ahead!

## Inspiration
Our old website wasn't in the best condition, so I was asked to make a new one, from scratch. I took inspiration from the original website, but largely made it my own by adding my own style. I tried my best to simplify the old website, condensing the pages from 10, to 5.

## Colors
I got the colors from their logo and previous website.

| Color                   | Hex              | RGB           | 
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Main Theme Color        | **#FB9106**      | 251, 145, 6   |
| Secondary Theme Color   | **#FED8AA**      | 254, 216, 170 |
| Main Text Color         | **#FFFFFF**      | 255, 255, 255 |
